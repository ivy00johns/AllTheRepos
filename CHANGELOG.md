# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. The section for a version is what gets attached
as that release's notes — `scripts/release-notes.mjs` refuses to let a release
go out without one — so write the entry in the same commit that bumps the
version.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) · versions
follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). `package.json` is the
source of truth for the current version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pnpm release:next` derives the next version and its changelog section from
  the commits since the last `v*` tag — the level by conventional-commit rules,
  hand-written `[Unreleased]` bullets merged in rather than replaced — and only
  writes, commits and tags with `--write --tag`. Bumping the version was the
  last step that could go wrong quietly.
- `pnpm release:verify` reads a published release back and fails if the DMG,
  the ZIP or `latest-mac.yml` is missing, if the tag disagrees with
  `package.json`, or if the manifest names a version or file the release does
  not carry. CI runs it twice: on the draft, before it can be seen, and again
  once published.

### Changed

- Update checks read a public releases repository, so they work for anyone who
  installs the app. Previously the feed was private and the app needed a GitHub
  token on the machine, which meant a copy on anyone else's Mac could never
  check.
- Releases are built and published by CI on a `v*` tag, with the changelog
  section below as the release notes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06

The first version with a release pipeline. Everything below reached the tree
well before this file existed; this entry is the backfill.

### Added

- **Catalog** — filesystem scanner with a debounced live watcher, folder
  grouping on disk, repo moves that survive through a relocation journal,
  favorites, covers, per-repo tasks, and a table view built for triaging
  hundreds of repos.
- **Claude integration** — per-project usage trends, a transcript viewer, and
  MCP server detection, on top of the existing process and launcher services.
- **Relationship map** — a `/graph` canvas over derived signals (shared
  libraries, references, submodules, owner, naming) with curated links folded
  in at the highest weight.
- **MCP server** (`mcp/`) — six tools (`find_repos`, `get_repo`, `get_map`,
  `link`, `unlink`, `list_links`) so a Claude Code session can read the
  catalog and curate relationships.
- **Curating from the app** — the repo detail panel and the map's inspector
  assert and remove links themselves, stamped with their origin, with the same
  rules the MCP enforces.
- **Updates** — a GitHub Releases feed checked on launch and from Settings,
  with an "Update to X" affordance. Installing stays manual: this build is
  ad-hoc signed, and macOS refuses to apply an update that isn't validly
  code-signed.

### Changed

- Repos are addressed by path, not slug, below the UI, so identity survives a
  rename or a move.

### Fixed

- Tag search was missing freshly-scanned rows: the FTS insert trigger wrote an
  empty tag column, so a repo only became findable by tag after a later
  update. Triggers are recreated on every boot, which repairs existing
  databases rather than only new ones.

### Notes

- macOS only, Apple silicon, ad-hoc signed. A downloaded DMG needs one
  right-click → **Open** on first launch.
- Native modules are rebuilt per runtime ABI; `pnpm test` (host Node) and
  `pnpm test:electron-e2e` (Electron) each put the tree in the state they need.
